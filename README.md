## Purpose

The purpose of this functionality is to provide a convenient way for users to download users data in CSV format. This can be useful for various purposes, such as data analysis or exporting data for other applications.

## Usage

### Downloading CSV

To download users data in CSV format, make a GET request to the `/user/users-csv` endpoint. The CSV file will be automatically downloaded.

Example:
```bash
curl -OJ http://localhost:8080/user/users-csv
## Configuration

The CSV download functionality is configured in the Spring Boot application using the `UserController` class. The configuration includes setting up the endpoint for CSV download and configuring the CSV generation logic.

### CSV Generation Logic

The CSV generation logic uses a `BufferedWriter` to write CSV data to the response. The data is retrieved from the database using the `UserService` and converted to CSV format.
## Using StreamingResponseBody

**StreamingResponseBody** is employed to efficiently stream large amounts of data, such as CSV content, directly to the HTTP response without buffering the entire content in memory. This is essential for handling potentially large datasets, ensuring optimal memory usage and responsiveness.

### Customization

To customize the CSV download functionality, you can modify the following components:


### Using BufferedWriter

`BufferedWriter` is used to efficiently write the CSV data directly to the HTTP response. This ensures that the CSV content is streamed without buffering the entire content in memory, making it suitable for handling potentially large datasets and providing optimal memory usage and responsiveness.

The CSV data is written to the response line by line, enhancing performance and allowing the seamless download of the CSV file, even for substantial amounts of data.
